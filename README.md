- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @citrus73.
- ðŸ‘€ In my daily life, I prefer reading books and listening to music, which helps me relax.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently concentrating on learning the Vue framework and also continuously studying the programming languages JavaScript and TypeScript, although they are a bit difficult for me.
- ðŸ˜„ If you are interested in my learning journey, feel free to follow me.
- âš¡ Fun fact: In addition, I'm also fascinated by mystery books and films that always stimulate my thinking and curiosity.
